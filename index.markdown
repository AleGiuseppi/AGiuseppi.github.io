I am an Assistant PRofessor (RTda) in Automatica at the University of Rome "La Sapienza", working at the [Network Control Laboratory](http://diag.uniroma1.it/nclab/) of the Department of Computer, Control, and Management Engineering ([DIAG](http://diag.uniroma1.it)) "Antonio Ruberti" and member of its [Networked System Research Group](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en/gruppi-di-ricerca/18328).

My research interests are mostly related to Intelligent Control Systems and Control Methods for the analysis and control of Smart Networks.

Since 2017 I have collaborated with the Consortium for the Research in Automation and Telecomunications ([CRAT](https://www.crat.eu)) in the scope of various EU and national funded projects.
