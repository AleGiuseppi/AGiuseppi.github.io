abstract={Background: Late neurocognitive sequelae are common among long-term brain tumour survivors, resulting in significantly worse quality of life. Cognitive rehabilitation through specific APP/software for PC/tablets represents an innovative intervention spreading in recent years. In this study, we aim to review the current evidence and trends regarding these innovative approaches. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed. Inclusion criteria were: (i) Studies recruiting patients diagnosed with any brain tumour before 21 years of age; (ii) studies assessing the role of digital interventions on cognitive outcomes. Case reports, case series, reviews, letters, conference proceedings, abstracts, and editorials were excluded. Results: Overall, nine studies were included; 152 patients (67.8% males) with brain tumours underwent a digital intervention. The mean age at diagnosis and the intervention enrolment ranged from 4.9 to 9.4 years and 11.1 to 13.3 years, respectively. The computer-based software interventions employed were: Cogmed, Captain’s Log, Fast ForWord, and Nintendo Wii. Most of these studies assessed the effects of cognitive training on working memory, attention, and performance in daily living activities. Conclusions: The studies suggest that this type of intervention improves cognitive functions, such as working memory, attention, and processing speed. However, some studies revealed only transient positive effects with a significant number of dropouts during follow-up. Trials with greater sample sizes are warranted. Motivating families and children to complete cognitive interventions could significantly improve cognitive outcomes and quality of life. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The aim of this work is to develop a robust control strategy able to drive the attitude of a spacecraft to a reference value, despite the presence of unknown but bounded uncertainties in the system parameters and external disturbances. Thanks to the use of an extended observer design, the proposed control law is robust against all the uncertainties that affect the high-frequency gain matrix, which is shown to capture a broad spectrum of modelling issues, some of which are often neglected by traditional approaches. The proposed controller then provides robustness against parametric uncertainties, as moment of inertia estimation, payload deformations, actuator faults and external disturbances, while maintaining its asymptotic properties. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Federated learning (FedL) is a machine learning (ML) technique utilized to train deep neural networks (DeepNNs) in a distributed way without the need to share data among the federated training clients. FedL was proposed for edge computing and Internet of things (IoT) tasks in which a centralized server was responsible for coordinating and governing the training process. To remove the design limitation implied by the centralized entity, this work proposes two different solutions to decentralize existing FedL algorithms, enabling the application of FedL on networks with arbitrary communication topologies, and thus extending the domain of application of FedL to more complex scenarios and new tasks. Of the two proposed algorithms, one, called FedLCon, is developed based on results from discrete-time weighted average consensus theory and is able to reconstruct the performances of the standard centralized FedL solutions, as also shown by the reported validation tests. © 2022, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The last decades saw a huge rise of artificial intelligence (AI) as a powerful tool to boost industrial and scientific research in a broad range of fields. AI and photonics are developing a promising two-way synergy: on the one hand, AI approaches can be used to control a number of complex linear and nonlinear photonic processes, both in the classical and quantum regimes; on the other hand, photonics can pave the way for a new class of platforms to accelerate AI-tasks. This review provides the reader with the fundamental notions of machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NNs) and presents the main AI applications in the fields of spectroscopy and chemometrics, computational imaging (CI), wavefront shaping and quantum optics.

abstract={A collision-free formation control strategy for flying in formation is presented. A linear control law is developed by means of Model Predictive Control (MPC) via the dual-mode paradigm [1]. Collision avoidance is dealt with by using Artificial Potential Functions (APFs) to keep a desired safe distance from the obstacles. The main innovation in the proposed approach is that each spacecraft independently performs the collision avoidance manoeuvres and, as a consequence, the APFs-based collision avoidance control is in charge also of the collision avoidance between two spacecraft. The optimality of the solution is discussed and numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022 IEEE.},

Such a problem represents a well known and relevant issue as it allows to efficiently manage the network's required energy and the interference experienced by end-users. With the widespread diffusion of smart devices, the relevance of this aspect further increased and has been identified as such also in 5G standards. The problem has been formalized as a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning approach (MARL) to guarantee scalability and robustness. These two aspects also drove the development of an original Distributed Average-Cost Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning algorithm. To adopt such an algorithm, a Markov Game formulation of the power control problem has also been derived. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed framework in reducing the total network's transmission power has been proved by means of simulations in a specific case study. copy; 2022 IEEE. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a summary of the results of the 5G-ALLSTAR project. It describes the enablers that have been developed and validated and will help make 5G and beyond satellite-terrestrial multi-connectivity (MC) a reality in the near future. We proposed and evaluated solutions for critical aspects of the integration of non-terrestrial networks into a 5G and beyond terrestrial network. The OpenAirInterface implementation of the 5G physical layer (PHY) has been upgraded to meet the satellite radio channel constraints. We addressed the issue of co-tier interference between satellite and terrestrial systems. We designed and implemented customized 5G Physical layer, specifically adapted for terrestrial-satellite spectrum sharing. On top of the dedicated beam-forming and hardware design, we validated the full potential of MC by conceiving and testing our proposed resource allocation algorithms based on a custom multipath TCP protocol. The contribution of MC in vehicular use cases has been demonstrated onsite by implementing a terrestrial 5G PHY in conjunction with a satellite/terrestrial traffic controller. Finally, radio resource management solutions were examined. Thanks to these tools, the presence of industry partners in the consortium and to an active participation in standardization, the 5G-ALLSTAR project is an accelerator for the integration of non-terrestrial networks in 5G and beyond. © 2022 IEEE.},

By augmenting the state space of the system with information on its visit time, the DeepRL agent is able to solve problems in which its task dynamically changes within the same episode. To address the scalability problems caused by the state space augmentation, we propose a procedure to partition the episode length to define separate sub-problems that are then solved by specialised DeepRL agents. Contrary to standard solutions, with the proposed approach the DeepRL agents correctly estimate the value function at each time-step and are hence able to solve time-varying tasks.

abstract={This paper presents a novel control system for the participation of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in the provisioning of ancillary services for frequency regulation, in a way that is transparent to the driver and harmonized with the smart charging service requirements. Given a power-frequency droop curve, which specifies how the set of PEVs collectively participate to the provisioning of the frequency regulation service (we call this curve a “global” droop curve), we propose an algorithm to compute “local” droop curves (one for each PEV), which are optimized according to the current status of the PEV and the current progress of the smart recharging session. Once aggregated, the local droop curves match the global one (so that the PEVs contribute as expected to the provisioning of the ancillary service). One innovative aspect of the proposed algorithm is that it is specifically designed to be interoperable with the algorithms that control the PEV recharging process; hence, it is transparent to the PEV drivers. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed solution. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Fire monitoring and early detection are critical tasks in which Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are commonly employed. This paper presents a system to plan the drone patrolling schedule according to a real-time estimation of a fire propagation index that is derived from satellite data, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) measurement and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the surveilled area. The proposed system employs a waypoint scheduling logic, derived from a dynamic Voronoi Tessellation of the area, that combines characteristics of the territory (e.g., vegetation density) with real-time measurements (e.g., wind speed and direction). The system is validated on a case study in Italy, in the municipality of the city of L’Aquila, on three different fire scenarios. In normal situations, the designed waypoint-based navigation system provided an effective monitoring of the area, enabling the early detection of starting fires. The developed solution also demonstrated good performance in tracking and anticipating the fire front advance, potentially providing a better situational awareness to emergency operators and support their response policies.

abstract={Federated Learning is a distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning technique that allows local clients to learn a model without sharing their own data by coordinating with a global server. In this work, we present the Adaptive Federated Learning (AdaFed) algorithm, which aims at improving the training performance of deep neural networks in Federated Learning settings by: (i) dynamically weighting the local models in the model averaging procedure; (ii) by adapting the loss function used by the federation at every communication round. We discuss the specialisation of AdaFed for both classification and regression tasks, providing several validation examples. Due to its adaptive design, the AdaFed algorithm showed a robust behaviour against unbalanced data distributions and adversarial clients. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, a distributed, non-cooperative and dynamic load-balancing algorithm is proposed in the context of multi-commodity adversarial network equilibria with constrained providers’ capacities. The algorithm is proven to converge to a generalised Wardrop user-equilibrium, referred to as Beckmann equilibrium in the literature, in which, for each commodity, the latencies of the unsaturated providers are equalized. The algorithm is then used as a Multi-connectivity algorithm in the context of 5G heterogeneous networks, in which the user equipments are able to use different access networks simultaneously to increase the transmission capacity and/or to improve the transmission reliability. The proposed controller provides a solution for dynamic traffic steering by distributing the traffic load over the available heterogeneous access points, considered as capacity providers. Simulation results validate the approach. The developed network simulator is available as an open-source environment De Santis et al. (2020). © 2021 The Franklin Institute},

abstract={Forest fires cost the world an estimated value of 200 Billion dollars annually in damages. Furthermore, the main concerns are not only monetary as the vanishment of the carbon-dioxide soaking forests further exacerbates climate change. This paper presents a predictor system based on deep convolutional neural network to predict the risk level of wildfire from satellite data. The proposed Neural Network has an encoder-decoder architecture that allows to provide emergency operators with a pixel-wise fire risk prediction of a given area, allowing precise preventive interventions. The dataset utilised for the training has been generated from publicly available sources as a set of raster images, including several of the most significant satellite products. The paper also proposes a customised loss function for the training of the network and several statistical metrics to establish its performances and validate the reliability of the system.

abstract={Broadband Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (B-CARS) is a powerful label-free nonlinear spectroscopy technique allowing one to measure the full vibrational spectrum of molecules and solids [1] - [2]. B-CARS spectra, however, suffer from the presence of a spurious signal, called non-resonant background (NRB), which interferes with the resonant one, distorting the line shapes and degrading the chemical information. While several numerical techniques [3] are available to remove this unwanted contribution and extract the resonant vibrational signal of interest, they all require the user's intervention and sensitively depend on the spectral shape of the NRB, which needs to be measured independently. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={This article presents a multicommodity, discrete-Time, distributed, and noncooperative routing algorithm, which is proved to converge to an equilibrium in the presence of heterogeneous, unknown, time-varying but bounded delays. Under mild assumptions on the latency functions, which describe the cost associated with the network paths, two algorithms are proposed: The former assumes that each commodity relies only on measurements of the latencies associated with its own paths; the latter assumes that each commodity has (at least indirectly) access to the measures of the latencies of all the network paths. Both algorithms are proven to drive the system state to an invariant set that approximates and contains the Wardrop equilibrium, defined as a network state in which no traffic flow over the network paths can improve its routing unilaterally, with the latter achieving a better reconstruction of the Wardrop equilibrium. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the last few years, with the exponential diffusion of smartphones, services for turn-by-turn navigation have seen a surge in popularity. Current solutions available in the market allow the user to select via an interface the desired transportation mode, for which an optimal route is then computed. Automatically recognizing the transportation system that the user is travelling by allows to dynamically control, and consequently update, the route proposed to the user. Such a dynamic approach is an enabling technology for multi-modal transportation planners, in which the optimal path and its associated transportation solutions are updated in real-time based on data coming from (i) distributed sensors (e.g., smart traffic lights, road congestion sensors, etc.); (ii) service providers (e.g., car-sharing availability, bus waiting time, etc.); and (iii) the user’s own device, in compliance with the development of smart cities envisaged by the 5G architecture. In this paper, we present a series of Machine Learning approaches for real-time Transportation Mode Recognition and we report their performance difference in our field tests. Several Machine Learning-based classifiers, including Deep Neural Networks, built on both statistical feature extraction and raw data analysis are presented and compared in this paper; the result analysis also highlights which features are proven to be the most informative ones for the classification. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={This letter proposes a lexicographic Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL)-based approach to chance-constrained Markov Decision Processes, in which the controller seeks to ensure that the probability of satisfying the constraint is above a given threshold. Standard DeepRL approaches require i) the constraints to be included as additional weighted terms in the cost function, in a multi-objective fashion, and ii) the tuning of the introduced weights during the training phase of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) according to the probability thresholds. The proposed approach, instead, requires to separately train one constraint-free DNN and one DNN associated to each constraint and then, at each time-step, to select which DNN to use depending on the system observed state. The presented solution does not require any hyper-parameter tuning besides the standard DNN ones, even if the probability thresholds changes. A lexicographic version of the well-known DeepRL algorithm DQN is also proposed and validated via simulations. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Broadband Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (B-CARS) is a powerful label-free nonlinear spectroscopy technique allowing one to measure the full vibrational spectrum of molecules and solids. B-CARS spectra, however, suffer from the presence of a spurious signal, called non-resonant background (NRB), which interferes with the resonant vibrational one, distorting the line shapes and degrading the chemical information. While several numerical techniques are available to remove this unwanted contribution and extract the resonant vibrational signal of interest, they all require the user's intervention and sensitively depend on the spectral shape of the NRB, which needs to be measured independently. In this work, we present a novel approach to remove NRB from B-CARS spectra based on deep learning. Thanks to the high generalization capability offered by the deep architecture of the designed neural network, trained through realistic simulated spectra, our fully automated model is able to process B-CARS spectra in real time and independently of the detailed shape of the NRB spectrum. This results in fast extraction of vibrational spectra without requiring user intervention or the measurement of reference spectra. We expect that this model will significantly simplify and speed-up the analysis of B-CARS spectra in spectroscopy and microscopy. © 2020 Author(s).},

abstract={The deep integration between the cyber and physical domains in complex systems make very challenging the security evaluation process, as security itself is more of a concept (i.e., a subjective property) than a quantifiable characteristic. Traditional security assessing mostly relies on the personal skills of security experts, often based on best practices and personal experience. The present work is aimed at defining a security metric allowing evaluators to assess the security level of complex cyber-physical systems (CPSs), as critical infrastructures, in a holistic, consistent and repeatable way. To achieve this result, the mathematical framework provided by the open source security testing methodology manual (OSSTMM) is used as the backbone of the new security metric, since it allows to provide security indicators capturing, in a non-biased way, the security level of a system. Several concepts, as component lifecycle, vulnerability criticality and damage potential – effort ratio are embedded in the new security metric framework, developed in the scope of the H2020 project ATENA.

abstract={The new challenge in power systems design and operation is to organize and control smart micro grids supplying aggregation of users and special loads as electric vehicles charging stations. The presence of renewable and storage can help the optimal operation only if a good control manages all the elements of the grid. New models of green buildings and energy communities are proposed. For a real application they need an appropriate and advanced power system equipped with a building automation control system. This article presents an economic model predictive control approach to the problem of managing the electric and heating resources in a smart building in a coordinated way, for the purpose of achieving in real time nearly zero energy consumption and automated participation to demand response programs. The proposed control, leveraging a mixed integer quadratic programming problem, allows to meet manifold thermal and electric users' requirements and react to inbound demand response signals, while still guaranteeing stable operation of the building's electric and thermal storage equipment. The simulation results, performed for a real case study in Italy, highlight the peculiarities of the proposed approach in the joint handling of electric and thermal building flexibility. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents an original discrete-time, distributed, noncooperative load-balancing algorithm, based on mean field game theory, which does not require explicit communications. The algorithm is proven to converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a specific equilibrium among the loads of the providers, known as Wardrop equilibrium. Thanks to its characteristics, the algorithm is suitable for the software-defined networking (SDN) scenario, where service requests coming from the network nodes, i.e., the switches, are managed by the so-called SDN controllers, playing the role of providers. The proposed approach is aimed at dynamically balancing the requests of the switches among the SDN controllers to avoid congestion. This paper also suggests the adoption of SDN Proxies to improve the scalability of the overall SDN paradigm and presents an implementation of the algorithm in a proof-of-concept SDN scenario, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed solution with respect to the current approaches. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Residential and non-residential buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the EU. Considering that almost 75% of the building stock in EU is energy inefficient, the European energy policy promotes the improvement of the energy performance of existing buildings by introducing the innovative model of nearly zero energy building (nZEB). In the nZEB model, local energy sources (generation, storage and load management), building automation (BACS) and electronic monitoring of technical building systems (TBS) play a fundamental role. In electric systems, smart grids are a key feature of future energy scenarios, with the overarching goal of better aligning energy generation and demand. The challenge is the role of the users. The nZEB model with its “smart microgrid” can represent an effective driver according to the new policies of user's aggregation. In this framework demand side management (DSM) strategies can be implemented. The paper presents an innovative approach to use BACS present in nZEBS not only to increase the efficiency of TBS but also to operate an energy storage by heating systems for DSM strategies. © 2018 IEEE},

abstract={Industrial and Automation Control systems traditionally achieved security thanks to the use of proprietary protocols and isolation from the telecommunication networks.

To this end, we propose a security framework and advanced tools to properly manage vulnerabilities, and to timely react to the threats. The proposed architecture fills the gap between computer science and control theoretic approaches. The physical layers connected to Industrial Control Systems are prone to disrupt when facing cyber-attacks. Considering the modules of the proposed architecture, we focus on the development of a practical framework to compare information about physical faults and cyber-attacks. This strategy is implemented in the ATENA architecture that has been designed as an innovative solution for the protection of critical assets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a stochastic algorithm for virtual network service mapping in virtualized network infrastructures, based on reinforcement learning (RL). An exact mapping algorithm in line with the current state of the art and based on integer linear programming is proposed as well, and the performances of the two algorithms are compared. While most of the current works in literature report exact or heuristic mapping methods, the RL algorithm presented here is instead a stochastic one, based on Markov decision processes theory. The aim of the RL algorithm is to iteratively learn an efficient mapping policy, which could maximize the expected mapping reward in the long run. Based on the review of the state of the art, the paper presents a general model of the service mapping problem and the mathematical formulation of the 2 proposed strategies. The distinctive features of the 2 algorithms, their strengths, and possible drawbacks are discussed and validated by means of numeric simulations in a realistic emulated environment.

abstract={In this paper a power system protection scheme based on energy storage system placement against closed-loop dynamic load altering attacks is proposed. The protection design consists in formulating a non-convex optimization problem, subject to a Lyapunov stability constraint and solved using a two-step iterative procedure.

abstract={This paper presents an optimal procedure for controlled electricity black start for electricity distribution grids in reaction to adverse events or malicious cyber attacks resulting in the interruption of the main power supply from transmission network. The islanded operation is supposed to be guaranteed by an electric energy storage system, which covers the network imbalance between demand and supply from distributed generation during the sequential reconnection of medium voltage branches. The objective is to restore the service to the consumers while avoiding violation of technical constraints in terms of storage power flow and battery capacity. The discussion of simulation results assesses the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the context of a simplified network model and gives rise to relevant remarks and requirements for further developments. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Network Functions Visualization is focused on migrating traditional hardware-based network functions to software-based appliances running on standard high volume severs. There are a variety of challenges facing early adopters of Network Function Virtualizations; key among them are resource and service mapping, to support virtual network function orchestration. Service providers need efficient and effective mapping capabilities to optimally deploy network services. This paper describes TeNOR, a micro-service based network function virtualisation orchestrator capable of effectively addressing resource and network service mapping. The functional architecture and data models of TeNOR are described, as well as two proposed approaches to address the resource mapping problem. Key evaluation results are discussed and an assessment of the mapping approaches is performed in terms of the service acceptance ratio and scalability of the proposed approaches. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The concept of Virtualization of Network Resources, such as cloud storage and computing power, has become crucial to any business that needs dynamic IT resources. With virtualization, we refer to the migration of various tasks, usually performed by hardware infrastructures, to virtual IT resources. This approach allows resources to be rapidly deployed, scaled and dynamically reassigned. In the last few years, the demand of cloud resources has grown dramatically, and a new figure plays a key role: the Cloud Management Broker (CMB). The CMB purpose is to manage cloud resources to meet the user's requirements and, at the same time, to optimize their usage. This paper proposes two multi-cloud resource allocation algorithms that manage the resource requests with the aim of maximizing the CMB revenue over time. The algorithms, based on Reinforcement Learning techniques, are evaluated and compared by numerical simulations. © 2015 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},
