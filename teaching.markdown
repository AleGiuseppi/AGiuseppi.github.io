## Available Theses

I have several open topics suitable for bachelord and master theses in any of the ongoing research projects that I list in the corresponding page. Since I do not update this website very often, students may send me an email to schedule an appointment.

To the interested (and determined) students, my research group could propose the possibility to do a master thesis in collaboration with a company (various industrial fields: space engineering, telecommunications, power systems).
