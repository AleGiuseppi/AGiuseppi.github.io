**IMPORTANT NEWS: WE ARE AWARE OF A PROBLEM REGARDING THE POSSIBILITY OF SELECTING THIS EXAM IN YOUR STUDY PROGRAMME**
We are working on a fix, in the meantime you may contact me (giuseppi@diag.uniroma1.it) for any questions.
Any student that faced this issue will be able to change the study programme and select this exam.
   
**Schedule**: The course will be active starting from the second semester of the academic year 2022/2023. 
A more detailed scheduling is TBA. 


The course is organized in two modules: the first deals with the design of the so-called intelligent control systems, whereas the second will cover hybrid systems.
My classes will cover the first module, whereas Prof. Luca Benvenuti will teach the second module.

Intelligent Control Systems is a class of controllers based on data-driven techniques such as deep learning and reinforcement learning. 

The course will present both the role of machine learning in control systems, discussing its methodologies, potential and applications, and the design of control systems based on artificial intelligence techniques. 

The course will also focus on how recent developments in deep learning can be exploited by standard control systems, discussing the basics of advanced data analysis using deep neural networks in the context of classical automation problems such as quality control, predictive maintenance and disturbance rejection.
In addition to the theoretical aspects, applications from the domains of industrial automation, robotics and cyber security will be presented.

Selected topics include: 
-safe reinforcement learning with stability guarantees
-neural lyapunov control
-deep learning enhanced model predictive control


**Program** (tentative) 
- Introduction to Machine Learning problems and the role of AI in Control Systems
- Introduction to fundamental deep learning solutions (DNN,CNN, RNN) and their applications in the automation domain
- Safe Reinforcement Learning
- Neural Lyapunov Control
- Advanced Predicitve Control though deep learning
